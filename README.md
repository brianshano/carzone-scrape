# Carzone Scraper Node App

Initially will attempt to scrape carzone.ie for specific car brand and model and return result range in an object consisting of Title and Price.

With Node installed, install puppeteer
`npm install --save puppeteer`

to run: `node carzone.js [car make] [car model]`
e.g. `node carzone.js ford focus`

## TODO 
  * Handle pagination
  * Allow further filtering
  * Do something useful with it!
  * Show price ranges
  * Comparisons?
